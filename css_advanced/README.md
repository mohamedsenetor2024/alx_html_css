<!-- # Complete Webpage HTML Skeleton

This project contains the full HTML skeleton for a multipurpose website layout including:

- Header with logo and navigation links
- Banner section with features and call-to-action
- Quote/testimonial section
- Videos list section with video details and ratings
- Membership plans section
- FAQ section with common questions and answers
- Footer with social media links and copyright

## Project Structure

- `index.html` â€” main HTML file containing the full page markup
- Images are referenced with placeholder filenames (e.g., `logo.png`, `feature1.png`) and should be replaced with actual image assets.

## Features

- Semantic HTML5 elements (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`, `nav`, etc.)
- Logical content grouping with nested blocks for clear structure
- Accessible markup with appropriate heading hierarchy (`h1` through `h3`)
- Placeholder content that can be easily customized
- Ready for CSS styling and responsive design enhancements

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the page structure.
2. Replace placeholder images and text with your own branding and content.
3. Add CSS styles to style the page and implement responsive layouts.

## Next Steps

- Add CSS styling to improve visuals and layout (Flexbox/Grid recommended).
- Enhance accessibility features (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).
- Integrate interactive behavior with JavaScript if needed.
- Optimize images and assets for performance.
